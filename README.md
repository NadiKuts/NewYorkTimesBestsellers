# FashionCloud Coding​ ​Challenge


<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> Use the Books-API of the New York Times.

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> The app uses routing. Start/home pages.  (You can go back to the home page by clicking on the NYtimes logo)

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> When the page that shows the API data is opened, it should load the necessary data
from the NYT Api and display it in a simple but structured way (no fancy UI needed).
Please show for each book in the list following information: The title, author, rank on
list and rank of previous week.

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> As a header of this page please also show a page title (e.g. ‘NYT Bestseller List’) and
“last_modified”.

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> Please add an icon for every book that indicates if the list rank compared to previous
week has improved, declined or stayed the same.

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> Please offer the user the choice to sort the list according to following criteria: name,
author, rank this week (default) or rank last week. Please implement the sorting on
the client. The API offers a sorting functionality but please use the features offered by
Angular.

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> Optional Task in case you still have time: Add a dropdown list so the user can
choose what bestseller list shall be used. For this you can use an additional endpoint
called “Besteller List Names”. Please display in the dropdown list the values of
“display_name” and load the data when a selection is made.

Please use Angular 1.5 or 2.0 and prefer to use components

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> Create a public Github repo for the code. Commit your progress with good commit
message and in sensible chunks

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> Test the code in a way that seems appropriate to you in a professional environment

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> Use standards and best practices as best as you can

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> Pretend you have a big team and make it really easy for them to run the app and to
maintain it for years to come. Also think about the architecture and reusable
components

<img height="15px" width="15px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/check.png"> Please focus on functionality first and a clean coding style and worry about design
later.
