<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> Use the Books-API of the New York Times.

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> The app uses routing. Start/home pages.  (You can go back to the home page by clicking on the NYtimes logo)

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> The page loads the necessary data from the NYT Api and display it in a simple but structured way

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> ‘NYT Bestseller List’ Header and “last_modified”.

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> Icon for every book that indicates if the list rank compared to previous week has improved, declined or stayed the same.

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> Possibility to sort the list according to : name, author, rank this week (default) or rank last week.

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/cancel.png"> Optional Task in case you still have time:

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> Please use Angular 1.5

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/question.png"> Prefer to use components. **The last time I worked with Angular was quite some time ago, and at that time it didn't have components (and from what I read about it today, components in Angular have quite different syntax and project structure). After that I switched to React and didn't really have a chance to dive into components syntax in Angular 1.5. I totally understand that treating book cards would be a much better approach from 'reusability' standpoint.**

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> Create a public Github repo for the code. Commit your progress with good commit message and in sensible chunks

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> Test the code. **I used Protractor. Set up instructions are given below**

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/question.png"> Use standards and best practices as best as you can. **If I would have started to use components or Angular 2 with Typescript, I could use ES6**

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> Pretend you have a big team and make it really easy for them to run the app and to maintain it for years to come.

<img height="20px" width="20px" src="https://github.com/NadiKuts/NewYorkTimesBestsellers/blob/master/app/images/check.png"> Please focus on functionality first and a clean coding style and worry about design later.
